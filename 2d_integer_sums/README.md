### largest_sum_path()

#### Given a 2D grid of integers, find the largest sum of any connected path of cells. A path consists of horizontally or vertically adjacent cells (no diagonals) and cannot reuse cells. Return the largest sum.


Example:

````
const grid1 = [ 
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6], 
    [7, 8, 9] 
]; 

const grid2 = [ 
    [5, 3],
    [2, 8]
];

largest_sum_path(grid1) > 45 // (1 → 2 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 8 → 7 → 4 → 5) 
largest_sum_path(grid2) > 18 // (5 → 3 → 8 → 2)
